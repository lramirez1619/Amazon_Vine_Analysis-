**Overview of the analysis:**
The goal of this research is to find out if there is any positivity bias in the Amazon Vine program reviews, which are part of a program that allows chosen reviewers to receive free or heavily discounted products in exchange for an honest assessment.

**Results:**
Total number of reviews:  99046 <div> 
Number of 5-star reviews for Vine program:  509 <div>
Number of 5-star reviews for non-Vine program:  45858 <div>
Percentage of 5-star reviews for Vine program:  0.51 % <div>
Percentage of 5-star reviews for non-Vine program:  46.3 % <div>

**Summary:**
According to the analysis, the proportion of Vine program reviews with five stars is substantially lower than the proportion of reviews with five stars that are not Vine reviews. This demonstrates that there is no prejudice in favor of positive reviews for the Vine program on Amazon.

One additional analysis that could be done with the dataset is to compare the average rating of Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews. This would provide more insights into whether there is any difference in the rating patterns of the two groups.
